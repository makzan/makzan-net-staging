In iOS, I’ve searched many text editor until I find Textastic app to supports the syntax highlight with plugin. I followed this Textastic forum post to install syntax plugin on the iPhone. Here is [&hellip;]</p>

					<p>I keep exploring different ways to write my next book. I’ve tried using Markdown, Markua, Pollen. They are all good at certain area, but none of them really fits my need on writing long technical book. Markua is the closest one, but the toolchain doesn’t work well for me. Recently I came across AsciiDoc and it’s implementation AsciiDoctor. It looks promising [&hellip;]</p>

					<p>I’ve been thinking not to use the blog style in my personal website—makzan.net. I think I can put all my tutorial here and keep the essays updated when they need to.
